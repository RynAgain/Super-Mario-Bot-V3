Recommendations:
  1. Review Lua memory address mappings and payload generation
  2. Validate WebSocket protocol implementation and payload structure
  3. Optimize system performance for real-time processing
  4. Optimize system performance for real-time processing
  5. Reduce CPU usage during processing
  6. Optimize memory usage and prevent memory leaks
  7. Improve processing throughput to maintain 60 FPS
  8. Reduce processing latency for real-time performance
  9. Address critical component failures before training
  10. Fix issues in lua memory reading
  11. Fix issues in binary protocol
  12. Fix issues in end to end integration
  13. Run extended validation tests before production use
  14. Monitor system behavior during initial training runs
