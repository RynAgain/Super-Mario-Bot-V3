## 🔧 Issues Resolved

### 1. Performance Measurement Framework ✅ FIXED
**Previous Issue:** Struct packing errors in performance tests  
**Resolution Applied:** 
- Added bounds checking for all struct.pack() operations
- Ensured all values are within valid ranges for their data types
- Fixed header packing with proper type validation
**Result:** All performance tests now pass with excellent metrics

### 2. Windows Console Compatibility ✅ FIXED
**Previous Issue:** Unicode emoji characters causing logging errors  
**Resolution Applied:**
- Replaced all emoji characters with ASCII equivalents:
  - ✅ → [PASS]
  - ❌ → [FAIL] 
  - ⚠️ → [WARN]
  - 🚀 → [START]
  - 📊 → [RESULTS]
  - And many more...
**Result:** Full Windows console compatibility restored

### 3. Dependencies Management ✅ RESOLVED
**Previous Issue:** Missing psutil and yaml packages  
**Resolution Applied:**
- Confirmed both packages are properly listed in requirements.txt
- Added graceful error handling for optional dependencies
- Improved fallback mechanisms when packages are unavailable
**Result:** All dependency issues resolved, system works with or without optional packages

### 4. Model Architecture Compatibility ✅ FIXED
**Previous Issue:** DuelingDQN parameter name mismatch  
**Resolution Applied:**
- Updated test to use correct parameter names:
  - `frame_channels` → `frame_stack_size`
  - `frame_height`, `frame_width` → `frame_size`
  - `action_size` → `num_actions`
  - `state_size` → `state_vector_size`
**Result:** All checkpoint compatibility tests now pass
